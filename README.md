# Code Guard - Your Code Quality Assistant

Code Guard is a VS Code extension that provides comprehensive code quality checks to help developers maintain high standards in their code. It ensures that the code adheres to best practices, follows coding style guidelines, and is free of bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.

## Features

- **Linting**: Automatically checks your code for style guide violations and ensures consistency across your codebase.
- **Bug Detection**: Uses static analysis to identify potential bugs and common programming pitfalls.
- **Code Formatting**: Enforces consistent code formatting rules across the entire project.
- **Best Practices**: Ensures that your code follows established industry best practices.
- **Security Checks**: Detects basic security issues such as hardcoded credentials or vulnerable patterns.
- **Performance Optimization**: Highlights inefficient code patterns that may negatively affect performance.

> Tip: You can configure the linting rules to match your team's style guide or coding preferences.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher) is required to install and run this extension.
- **ESLint**: The extension leverages ESLint for linting. Ensure that you have an `eslint` configuration in your project (`.eslintrc.json` or similar).
  
You can install ESLint by running:

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

## Extension Settings

Code Guard adds the following settings:

- `codeGuard.enable`: Enable or disable the extension (default: `true`).
- `codeGuard.autoFixOnSave`: Automatically fix linting errors on save (default: `false`).
- `codeGuard.lintingRules`: Specify custom ESLint rules to override the default configuration.

## Usage

1. Install the extension from the VS Code marketplace.
2. Open your project and run the `Code Guard: Lint Current File` command to lint the currently active file.
3. Optionally, enable auto-fixing by setting `codeGuard.autoFixOnSave` to `true`.

## Known Issues

- **Dynamic Imports Warning**: Due to ESLint’s dynamic rule loading, some warnings might appear in the console. These do not affect functionality but may clutter logs.
- **Large File Handling**: Linting very large files may slow down performance.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

- Initial release of Code Guard with core features: linting, bug detection, code formatting, and security/performance checks.

### 1.1.0

- Added auto-fix on save feature and performance improvements.
